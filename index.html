        Mahendra Singh Dhoni (MS Dhoni) is a legendary Indian cricketer and former
        captain of the Indian cricket team, widely regarded as one of the greatest
        players in the history of the sport. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi,
        Jharkhand, Dhoni rose to fame for his calm and composed leadership style,
        earning the nickname "Captain Cool." He led India to numerous victories,
        including winning the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC Cricket
        World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013, making him the
        only captain to win all three major ICC trophies. Known for his aggressive
        batting, especially in clutch situations, Dhoni is famous for his unique
        "helicopter shot" and his exceptional wicketkeeping skills, setting
        numerous records in international cricket. He captained India in all three
        formats—Test, ODI, and T20I—until his retirement from Tests in 2014 and
        ODIs and T20Is in 2017. Dhoni retired from international cricket on August
        15, 2020, leaving behind a legacy of remarkable achievements. He continues
        to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL), leading the Chennai Super
        Kings (CSK) to multiple titles. Off the field, Dhoni is known for his love
        of motorcycles and holds the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the
        Indian Territorial Army. His journey from a small-town boy to an
        international superstar is a source of inspiration for millions.
